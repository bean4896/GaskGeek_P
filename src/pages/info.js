         â€” is probably one of the most asked questions by creatives in their careers.<br /> 
         <strong className='text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-200'> Technologies come and go, the software and the technology we learned in school are no longer the best solutions in today's digital world. </strong>
        School won't teach you to use Figma for web designs, won't teach you to use a 3rd-party renderer like Octane to do some high-end commercial renders.
          <br /><br />
          Thus, I built this website to share my learning journey and help you to book mark up-to-date resources, the best tool for your next project.</div>
